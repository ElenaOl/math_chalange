# Approach taken: #

_Planning:_
## User Stories ##

* As a user, I want my child to practice basic mathematical exercises.
* As a user, I want to know what is my child's progress on every level, see improvement in time and amount of questions the child solves.



_Execution:_ 

1. I have created a user that can sign in and add children.
2. I created the game, ability to choose level and operation for the game.
3. I created the count of amount of questions that were answered correctly out of 20 questions and a timer to be able to see an improvement. 

# Unsolved problems #
_Things I would love to accomplish later:_
* Deletion of child
* Addition of operations
* change styling more child appropriate
